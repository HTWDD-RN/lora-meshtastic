Max EIRP / ERP	+16 dBm (40 mW) / +14 dBm (25 mW)
This is the power radiated by the isotropic antenna / half-wave dipole antenna (not the transmitter power)

Radio link budget formula  
𝑃RX=𝑃TX+𝐺TX+𝐺RX−𝐿TX−𝐿FS−𝐿𝑃−𝐿RX  
PRX  = received power (dBm)  
PTX  = transmitter output power (dBm)  
GTX  = transmitter antenna gain (dBi)  
GRX  = receiver antenna gain (dBi)  
LTX  = transmit feeder and associated losses (feeder, connectors, etc.) (dB)  
LFS  = free space loss or path loss (dB)  
LP  = miscellaneous signal propagation losses (these include fading margin, polarization mismatch, losses associated with medium through which signal is travelling, other losses...) (dB)  
LRX  = receiver feeder and associated losses (feeder, connectors, etc.) (d)B
